<h1>Pomodoro-App-GRZ</h1>

Pomodoro-App-GRZ is a mobile application built using React Native that allows users to set a timer for different time intervals and start a countdown to help them stay focused and productive. The app is named after the Pomodoro technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
